This is the code for the electromagnetic side of geophysical transients
The code consists of two main programs and five subroutines, namely: (1) numerical simulation main program, (2) measured data reading main program, (3) one-dimensional (uniform) media numerical simulation subroutine, (4) calculation of apparent resistance subroutine, (5) calculation of background resistivity subroutine, (6) correction of resistivity coefficient subroutine, and (7) time-depth conversion subroutine.
